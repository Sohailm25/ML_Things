# Machine Learning Projects

## Logistic_Regression + Naive_Bayes R vs. C++ (March 1, 2021)

Here **I coded a Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes model in C++** from scratch, and compared the performance against the built-in glm() and naiveBayes() functions. Through this _I learned the Algorithm for each of these techniques and how to implement them on a real dataset._

## Pacman Search Algorithms

Here **I implemented Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Uniform-Cost Search, AStar Search, and a modified UCS and AStar Search with a Heuristic.** Through this _I learned Uninformed and Informed Search Algorithms and how to implement them for a real world problem._ I ensured the Search Algorithms were generalizable to any problem.
